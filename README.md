# Gambler's Fallacy
- The Gambler's fallacy, also known as the Monte Carlo Fallacy is a form of cognitive bias and representativeness heuristic. It is used in Probabilistic Graphical Models in Machine Learning.
- It occurs when an individual erroneously believes that a certain random event is less likely or more likely to happen based on the outcome of a previous event or series of events.
- Example: "If I flip a coin 4 times, and the probability of it landing heads or tails is 50% for each outcome, what is the order of likelihoods for each of the following sequences occurring: 
   A) H H H T <br>
   B) H H H H <br>
   C) H H T T<br>
   i.e. if you think A is most likely, followed by B, followed by C, choose A, B, C."
